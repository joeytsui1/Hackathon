                <h3>Digital X-Ray</h3>
                <p>
                  Imaging with x-rays involves exposing a part of the body to a
                  small dose of radiation to produce a digital image. X-rays are
                  most commonly used to diagnose diseases of the chest (such as
                  pneumonia or lung cancer) and bone disorders (such as
                  arthritis or bone fractures).

                <h3>Ultrasound</h3>
                <p>
                  Ultrasound scanning, also called “ultrasound imaging” or
                  “sonography,” uses high-frequency sound waves to produce
                  images of the body. Ultrasound does not use ionizing radiation
                  and does not involve x-ray exposure.

                <h3>Digital Mammography</h3>
                <p>
                  Mammography is a low-dose x-ray examination of the breast. A
                  mammogram is used in the early detection and diagnosis of
                  breast diseases. Current national guidelines recommend annual
                  screening mammography for all women age 40 and over.

                <h3>Fluoroscopy</h3>
                <p>
                  Fluoroscopy is a special x-ray technique that makes it
                  possible to see internal organs in motion. Through a series of
                  consecutive x-rays, a video of the organ of interest is
                  generated.

                <h3>Thyroid Biopsy</h3>
                <p>
                  During a fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid, a small
                  sample of cells is removed from the thyroid gland. Samples of
                  the cells are put on a slide for review by the pathologist.
                  The pathologist will examine the cells under a microscope to
                  determine if they are benign or cancerous.

                <h3>Bone Densitometry</h3>
                <p>
                  Bone density scanning, also called dual-energy x-ray
                  absorptiometry (DXA) or bone densitometry, is an enhanced form
                  of x-ray technology that is used to measure bone loss and to
                  predict risk of bone fracture. DXA is most often performed on
                  the lower spine and hips. Many national guidelines recommend
                  testing all women age 65 and over.

                <h3>CT Scan</h3>
                <p>
                  A Computed Tomography or CT scan is an imaging test that
                  combines computers and 360-degree x-rays to produce highly
                  detailed images of the body. CT scans are one of the best
                  tools to look for sources of pain in the abdomen or pelvis, to
                  find the causes of breathing difficulty, to show the extent of
                  cancers, or to demonstrate problems of the skeleton.

                <h3>PET/CT</h3>
                <p>
                  PET/CT is an advanced imaging test that offers information on
                  both tissue metabolism and structure that is not attainable
                  using other conventional imaging procedures. Using a small
                  amount of radioactive tracer, PET/CT is often used to
                  distinguish between healthy and abnormal tissue such as in
                  cancer. Because PET/CT is able to pinpoint molecular activity
                  throughout the body, it has the potential to identify cancer
                  at its earliest stages.

                <h3>MRI</h3>
                <p>
                  Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides highly detailed pictures
                  of anatomy and pathology to help evaluate a wide range of
                  conditions anywhere in the body. MRI uses a strong magnetic
                  field and radiofrequency pulses to produce clear and detailed
                  pictures. MRI does not use ionizing radiation and does not
                  involve x-ray exposure.
