                  <h3>Digital X-Ray</h3>
                  <p>
                    Imaging with x-rays involves exposing a part of the body to
                    a small dose of radiation to produce a digital image. X-rays
                    are most commonly used to diagnose diseases of the chest
                    (such as pneumonia or lung cancer) and bone disorders (such
                    as arthritis or bone fractures).

                  <h3>Ultrasound</h3>
                  <p>
                    Ultrasound scanning, also called “ultrasound imaging” or
                    “sonography,” uses high-frequency sound waves to produce
                    images of the body. Ultrasound does not use ionizing
                    radiation and does not involve x-ray exposure.

                  <h3>Digital Mammography</h3>
                  <p>
                    Mammography is a low-dose x-ray examination of the breast. A
                    mammogram is used in the early detection and diagnosis of
                    breast diseases. Current national guidelines recommend
                    annual screening mammography for all women age 40 and over.

                  <h3>Fluoroscopy</h3>
                  <p>
                    Fluoroscopy is a special x-ray technique that makes it
                    possible to see internal organs in motion. Through a series
                    of consecutive x-rays, a video of the organ of interest is
                    generated.

                  <h3>Thyroid Biopsy</h3>
                  <p>
                    During a fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid, a
                    small sample of cells is removed from the thyroid gland.
                    Samples of the cells are put on a slide for review by the
                    pathologist. The pathologist will examine the cells under a
                    microscope to determine if they are benign or cancerous.

                  <h3>Bone Densitometry</h3>
                  <p>
                    Bone density scanning, also called dual-energy x-ray
                    absorptiometry (DXA) or bone densitometry, is an enhanced
                    form of x-ray technology that is used to measure bone loss
                    and to predict risk of bone fracture. DXA is most often
                    performed on the lower spine and hips.

                  <h3>CT Scan</h3>
                  <p>
                    A Computed Tomography or CT scan is an imaging test that
                    combines computers and 360-degree x-rays to produce highly
                    detailed images of the body. CT scans are one of the best
                    tools to look for sources of pain in the abdomen or pelvis,
                    to find the causes of breathing difficulty, to show the
                    extent of cancers, or to demonstrate problems of the
                    skeleton.

                  <h3>PET/CT</h3>
                  <p>
                    PET/CT is an advanced imaging test that offers information
                    on both tissue metabolism and structure that is not
                    attainable using other conventional imaging procedures.
                    Using a small amount of radioactive tracer, PET/CT is often
                    used to distinguish between healthy and abnormal tissue such
                    as in cancer.

                  <p>
                    Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides highly detailed pictures
                    of anatomy and pathology to help evaluate a wide range of
                    conditions anywhere in the body. MRI uses a strong magnetic
                    field and radiofrequency pulses to produce clear and
                    detailed pictures. MRI does not use ionizing radiation and
                    does not involve x-ray exposure.

                    Breast tomosynthesis or 3D mammography is an FDA approved
                    advanced technology that can improve detection of breast
                    cancer, particularly in women with dense breast since it
                    provides a clearer image of dense breast tissue.
